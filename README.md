`TrashureHunt` is app that provides a platform that encourages and rewords __*cleaning of the environment*__. It does that by letting users to mark the thrash locations on a map. They can than decide to take __individual action__ or he/she can organise a __community event__ in order to take care of the marked location. 

After the cleaning is done, all users are reworded with a certain amount of __points__ that reflects the amount of trash that they have reported and/or cleaned.
