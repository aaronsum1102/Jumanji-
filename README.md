`TrashureHunt` is a platform that encourages and rewards __*helping clean the environment*__. It does so by letting users report thrash locations on an active map. User can than choose to take an __individual action__ or he/she can organise a __community event__ to take care of the reported location. 

For taking actions as reporting or cleaning user is rewarded with __points__ accordingly. Additional __points__ are gained for participating in a community event. 
User holds a __rank__ based on their total score. Besides having bragging rights, users can exchange these points for discounts and other benefits from our `partner shops`.

After user is logged in, a screen with a __map__ containing pins from all users is shown. If a location is marked with a red pin it means that it has only been reported and that action needs to be taken. 
If the pin is green, it means that the location has already been cleaned. To mark a location clean, first clean the reported trash in the marked area, then press the red pin and when the popup is shown press the __Clean Me__ button.
